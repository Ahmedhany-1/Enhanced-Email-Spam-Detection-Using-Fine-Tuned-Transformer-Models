## Abstract
Spam emails and phishing attacks continue to pose significant challenges to email users worldwide, necessitating advanced techniques for their efficient detection and classification. In this paper, we address the persistent challenges of spam emails and phishing attacks by introducing a cutting-edge approach to email filtering. Our methodology revolves around harnessing the capabilities of advanced language models, particularly the state-of-the-art GPT-4 Large Language Model (LLM), along with BERT and RoBERTa Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Through meticulous fine-tuning tailored for spam classification tasks, we aim to surpass the limitations of traditional spam detection systems, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Through an extensive literature review, experimentation, and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying spam and phishing emails while minimizing false positives. Our methodology showcases the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for specialized tasks like spam classification, offering enhanced protection against evolving spam and phishing attacks. This research contributes to the advancement of spam filtering techniques and lays the groundwork for robust email security systems in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.
